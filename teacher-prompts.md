Stan's prompt:
First help me improve my prd (documentation). Currently, i only have one prd at: docs/prd/landing-page.md; but it's mixing up landing page, frontend app and backend app.
I've created folders under this space for landing, frontend and backend respectively. Separate the original doc (docs/prd/landing-page.md) into 3 new docs for landing, frontend and backend:

1. landing: i've downloaded a react app template - please just generate a prd on how to modify the copy
2. frontend: we will build a new react app
3. backend: we will build a new nodejs (typescript) express server  
   Generate production ready prd; ask any questions if need to.

What is the primary goal of the landing page? This helps define the copy focus. → Product showcase
· For the frontend app MVP, which features should be included in Phase 1? → Full P0 features
· What authentication approach for the backend? → Email + Phone (Recommended)
· What language should the PRDs be written in? → English (Recommended)
